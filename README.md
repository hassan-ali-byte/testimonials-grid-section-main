## ⚙️ My Process

### Built With

- ✅ Semantic **HTML5 markup** (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<blockquote>`)

- 📱 **Mobile-first workflow** for responsiveness

## 📚 What I Learned

This challenge helped me strengthen my understanding of **CSS Grid**:

- Practiced both **grid-template-columns/rows** and **grid-template-areas**, and found **areas** much easier and more readable for this type of layout.
- Focused on **base styling using grouped selectors**, reducing repetitive CSS.
- Kept the structure **simple and semantic**, avoiding unnecessary wrappers.

## 📂 Extra Notes  

For study purposes, I’ve also included a separate file: **learning.css**.  
This file contains my experimental attempts with **grid-template-columns/rows** before I settled on using **grid-template-areas** in the final solution.  

It’s not linked to the HTML — it’s only there for personal learning and future reference.
